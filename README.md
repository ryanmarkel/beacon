Simple Podcasting for WordPress

Why?
===

Because pretty much every other podcasting plugin is too complicated or overly-designed and there's a need for something simple. Oh, and I needed a project to work on. :)

Requirements (a.k.a. TODO)
==========================

* Create new feed at `/podcast/` that conforms to the iTMS podcasting spec
* Create admin page that allows users to input podcast metadata for that spec
* Create and use a custom post type for podcasts
* Create new metaboxes for that custom post type that allow altering the metadata per episode
* Create controls that use the media modal to help users manually set enclosure location, either by uploading a file or selecting an external URL

Nice to Have
============

* Stats, either directly or through supporting an external service like Podtrac
* Conversion scripts that would allow importing from another podcasting plugin

Resources
=========

* [iTunes Store RSS Specification](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html)
* [Codex Page on Building RSS Feeds](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_Feeds)
* [RSS feed validator](http://validator.w3.org/feed/)
